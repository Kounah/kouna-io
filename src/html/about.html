          <p class="flow-text">Hey there its me. <br>
          What you don't know me, okay okay I'll introduce myself.
          My name is Kouna, sometimes Kounah (because it was taken :/),
          however I am {{
            let moment = require('moment');

            '' + Math.floor(moment.duration(moment() - moment('1999-07-05')).asDays());
          }} Days old (Yeah days, deal with it). I also am a programmer, thats basically why this site exists and is as it is. I actually am more of a Gamer and Otku, bit since I cannot earn any money with that I decided to work as a programmer).
          </p>

          <p class="flow-text">So thats enough about poor me, lets show you what I am into the most at this time, its a Game called Blade'n'Soul (Google it, links are expensive). So however thats an MMORPG all about martial arts an my char there is a Blade Dancer (cooler than Blade Masters because we are cute in addition)</p>
