          <h1>Hello World</h1>
          <p>This is my homepage, or to be more precisely the second version of my homepage.</p>
          <h4>Why I decided to rework my homepage</h4>
          <p>I didn't like the way i served content, i had to always rebuild my server backend if i wanted to change some content, so now i created a way to use templates that are aware of their surrounding nodejs environment and can still be changed and replaced during run-time.</p>
